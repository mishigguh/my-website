  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m a movement teacher, bodyworker, artist, and dad living in Colorado. My work blends structural bodywork, somatic education, strength and coordination training, and deep attention to the nervous system.</p>

  <p>I’ve been exploring the connection between perception, creativity, and physical intelligence for over a decade. My sessions are equal parts physical, mental, and reflective. This is about transformation through consistent practice and conscious inquiry.</p>

  <p>This site is a place to share ideas, offer my services, and connect with people who are drawn to embodiment, healing, and growth through creative practice.</p>
