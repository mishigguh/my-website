  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m a movement teacher, bodyworker, and artist, living in Colorado with my wife and two kids. My work blends structural and somatic bodywork, movement practices, and attention to the nervous system.</p>

  <p>I’ve been exploring the connection between perception, creativity, and physical intelligence for over a decade. My sessions are equal parts physical, mental, and reflective. This is about self understanding through consistent practice and conscious inquiry.</p>

  <p>This site is a place to share ideas, offer my services, and connect with people who are drawn to this type of work.</p>

<h1>What I'm up to now</h1>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic; color: #888;">Updated June 14th, 2025</p>
<p>I've just submitted exams for year 2 of the Human Movement Studies program. Starting September we are launching movement study cohorts for continued physical education and community practice. It has been a transition in the making as the Denver ApeCo closes its doors and opens the opportunity for new things to form.</p>
<p>I spend most of my time with family, especially the 11 month old, giving bodywork sessions, and training.</p>
<p>I am cultivating more <a href="Inducing-Somatic-Release.html">somatic release</a> in my bodywork practice. The paper is too dry right now, next draft can be more of a narrative.</p>
