  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m a movement teacher, bodyworker, and artist, living in Colorado with my wife and two kids. My work blends structural and somatic bodywork, movement practices, and attention to the nervous system.</p>

  <p>I’ve been exploring the connection between perception, creativity, and physical intelligence for over a decade. My sessions are equal parts physical, mental, and reflective. This is about self understanding through consistent practice and conscious inquiry.</p>

  <p>This site is a place to share ideas, offer my services, and connect with people who are drawn to this type of work.</p>

<h1>What I'm up to now</h1>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic; color: #888;">Updated June 14th, 2025</p>
<p>I'm studying movement through a program with Marcello Palozzo and am about to wrap up year two of a five year study. I am bringing a lot of the work from this program to my students and clients.</p>
<p>My baby boy is 8 months old, babbling, rolling around, and overall being a happy little guy. Family life is enriching, humbling, beautiful, an adventure.</p>
<p>I am cultivating more <a href="Inducing-Somatic-Release.html">somatic release</a> in my bodywork practice and have been researching and writing a comprehensive understanding of what is happening there.</p>
